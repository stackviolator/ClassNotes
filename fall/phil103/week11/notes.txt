Care Ethics/ The Ethics of Care - Last 50 years or so invented in the 1980
	- One of the critical theories of ethics
	- Looks at the tradition as a whole (virtue ethics, utilitarianism, deontology) are not sufficient
	- Unifying theories of all the theories so far
		- Universality
		- Reason

	- Carol Gilligan ( 1935 - present )
		- In a Different Voice ( 1982 )

Kohlberg's Stages of Moral Development
	Each human being should march through each stage, however this does not always happen
	Preconventional Stage - humans engage in moral activities and give explanations
		1.) Punishment Orientation
					fear of punishment
		2.) Self-Interest Orientation
					do good things so i will get rewarded
	Conventional Stage - Our stages of morality have to do with our conventions, its just what we do
		3.) Social Conformity Orientation
					well everybody does it therefore I will too
		4.) Authority Orientation
					"Man's self-incurred immaturity" - Kant
					what the law says so i will do it
	Post-Conventional
		5.) Social Contract Orientation
					Rational justification
		6.) Universal Principles
				Doing something because it is the duty to do so
				Categorical imperative
	Study was conducted on boys and men, when the findings were applied to women, the were unable to reach universal principles

Perspective
	Look at morality as if it is a simple photo or image, however we should look at it as if it has multiple interpretations
	Gestalt image, image with multiple interpretations
	Each moral problem is rich and complex with a multitude of explanations and considerations
	therefore thinking that something is right and wrong is fundamentally misleading

	Justice vs Care perspective
		not mutually exclusive
		involve taking a different perspective on a problem, both are equally valid
			not wrong for seeing a duck or a rabbit, both are correct

		Justice
			Masculine perspective (awesome and cool)
			Figure actor (abstract)
			autonomous self
			rational
			act as an individual rational moral agent
		Care
			Feminine perspective (for little baby people)
			Background relation (concrete)
			interdependent self
			responsive
			personal relations shape who you are and the decisions you make

Natural care - something that comes without thought
Moral care - memory of something else

Coming without a second thought - similar to VE
Concious decision you have to make
	whatever action youre making switches from natural to moral whenever you have to make a decision

Inner circle vs stranger
	Being a judge - you have to be a cold logician
	conflicts of interest, remove yourself from a position
	your dad commits murder, do you have an obligation to turn your dad in
	to prevent further damage - famlies
	out in the world

Possibility of losing a relationship
