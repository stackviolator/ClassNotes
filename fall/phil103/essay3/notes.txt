First half of the paper should be a detailed and charitable description of the concept at hand

Q1. Nietzsche attack on Mill - rigid does not allow for life affirmation in terms of appreciating what is means to be human

-- Week 5 --
Utilitarianism - the greatest happiness for the greatest number
	principle of utility
	method of defining a measureable good
		- pleasure
		- pain
		- happiness
		- unhappiness
		- etc.
	greatest happiness principle producing the greatest amount of pleasure for the greatest amount of people
	ends and means
		something is good if it produces pleasure and tends to produce pleasure in the long run
	people must also generate the correct type of pleasure
		- poll the population on what the best pleasure is
	empirical and scientific basis

-- Week6 --
	ends vs means
		ends = pleasure
		mean = the means to pleasure

-- Nietzschean argument against --
Utilitarianism = life negating
	people are not just means to an end
	people are ends in themselves

Humans have the rationality to make decisions on their own

Mill's utilitarianism is too rigid
	people are not just means to an end
	people are ends in themselves

Humans are rational creatures and deserve to be treated as such
	looking at life, differences and change as a positive
	can't prescribe or use the term "should"


John Stuart Mill's view of utilitarianism is wrong because...
	it fails to take into account the importance of individual will and self-expression.
	According to Nietzsche, human beings are not merely creatures who seek to maximize pleasure and minimize pain
	instead are creative and expressive beings who have the ability to shape their own lives and destinies

the idea of utilitarianism reduces human beings to mere instruments of pleasure and pain calculation
 fundamentally flawed because.. it does not recognize the inherent value and worth of individual will and self-expression
 instead of promoting the "flourishish" (or whatever Nietzsche uses as his term) of individual human beings, utilitarianism ultimately leads to the suppression and subjugation of human creativity and freedom
 	master morality vs. slave morality

in contrast Nietzsche gives a philosophy of "life affirming"
	individuals are encouraged to embrace their own unique desires and passions
	strive for self-actualization and self-fulfillment (what can they do vs what should others do)


-- Possible Concluding Sentence --
According to Nietzsche, only by embracing our own individuality and creativity can we truly thrive and flourish as human beings.
