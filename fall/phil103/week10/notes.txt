NOTES
------------------

O'niell's Kantian institutions
	- Principles
1. Mere means - consent in principle - endangerment, coercion, deception
2. ends in themselves - establish autonomy, independency system of mutual support
3. consequences - once we had done all else, what can be done?
		- 1 and 2 need to be satisfied before one can look at consequnces

Deontology vs Utilitarianism
	1. Deontology is less ambitious
		- right v. just
			- Deontology outlines what is just (beneficent)
				- Beneficence - the quality of performing a kind act
				- One MUST not treat someone as a mere means
				- yes, cannot view someone as a rock on the side of the road that can be passed by
			- Utilitarianism outlines what is right
	2. Deontology is less mathematical
		- quantity v. quality
			- Deontologists ensure there is some quality of life
			- not enough to prevent someone from suffering
		- Essential for Deontologists to consider autonomy
	3. Utilitarian does not argue that human lives and happiness are greater than other forms of life
		- if other beings are able to feel pleasure then they need to be considered in the moral calculus
		- Therefore, according to a util framework, it is potentially correct to remove all human beings
			- would remove human suffering and all the suffering humans cause on the world
		- O'neill argues this is wacky and that Deontology would respect human life

Deontological Commitments
	- biological life v biographical life
		- dont need to completely wipe out famine however, one should invest in sustainable options
			- dont give the proverbial man a fish, teach the proverbial man to fish
		- dont wipe out the problem but need to make sure the problem doesn't happen again
	- welfare at home
		- need the make sure that one does not overcommit their resources on a foreign issue
		- one also needs to make sure that the recipients of domestic welfare are not dependent on the government
	- When faced with an issue, one MUST do something that does not compromise the welfare of those at home
	- Famine relief

DISCUSSION - 2
------------------

How can we tell if something is right or wrong?
	value as a human being
	violates autonomy
	after these, look at consequences
Why does Deontology have a hard time prescribing the right action?
	It is not precisesly clear what it means to respect someone
	"Just respect someone's autonomy"
	Kantianism is known as the universal theory
	O'niell has lots of situtaional wiggle room in terms of positively what to do
	Needs to be obscure, treating someone as a human being
How should we evaluate various decisions?
	now look at the outcomes
		not looking at pure happiness
	is the choice going to be successful, how many people will this impact
