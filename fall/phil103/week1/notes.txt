NOTES
----------

Glaucon aruging for egoism
----------
1.) What is the origin of justice
	- Social contract
		- Intangible agreement to no do wrong to others in order to not have wrong done to you
	- We simply due what is natural, but suffering injury and injustice is unbearable
	- Egoism = Ethical behavior is guided by self interest
		- Psychological
		- "This is human nature"

2.) Justice is always practiced unwillingly
	- Humans by nature will pursue whatever they want which is usually harmful to others

3.) it is better to be unjust
	- Ethical egoism: human beings __should__ pursue their own self interest
	- Normative truth - a prescription, tells us what we should do


	it is just or unjust to commit a just act solely for self interest?

Discussion
----------
Someone thats selfless and cares about others
	Human nature is to be selfish, makes you feel good
	Not hard to overcome human nature (selfness) but it does make you a good person

Epathetic  - one of the best characteristics to have
	Easier to be selfish than to care about others
	not one single thing
	a culmination of everything

Considers everyone when making decisions
	cant always help other people
	not making bad decisions

Utilitarianism

Being nice and good for others
	cancels the fact that you make bad deisions

Can be good be good if you still make bad decisions
	dont have to be wholly good person

Ring of gyges
------------
Everyone would use it

At first would use it for:
	just being invisible
	going a concert you dont pay
	go a bank and rob it
		just for student loans

Would share the ring of gyges

Go to a different country (hop on a plane)

Cant live a life of ultimate pleasure
	humans always want something better
	get to the things quicker
	too easy you wont enjoy anything

Says something about society
	SOCIETY THESE DAYS
	need to pay off student loans - if there werent inherent flaws i would need to take bad action

Human nature is temptation
	I know i have it, why cant i use it
	people have malicious intentions
	power of the ring is craaaaazy
		smeagol moment

Money is not something that comes up

Psycho vs ethical
----------
Its good sometimes

Too selfless
	don't get walked all over
	don't get gaslit, do something you want to do sometimes
	friends can want you to do something that you dont want to do

Psychopaths
	People who explicitly derive pleasure from given

Shouldn't always act on their own self interest all the time
	but it is important to act on your own self interest at points

Judgement of when or when to not act on self interest

Reputation
----------
making friends
	human nature being social
	human nature to be cared for
		sense of protection

First thing people judge you on
	give other others opinions lots of weight

People don't want to be a bad person
	people saying whether its good or bad

Everyone has their own pursuit of happiness
	being surrounded by friend makes you happy
	bad rep = bad friends

rep matters more with people close to you
