Martha Nussbaum
	1947 - present

Non relative virtues ( 1987 - present )

Relativism
	the acknowledgment that depending upon the culture you are in, different things are virtuous
	the only criteria for goodness are local ones

	Rebuttals
		if you live in nazi germany, the culture is nazi germany, and therefore the culture is good

Trans-cultural norm
	universal criterion
	being able to criticize your own culture

When we try to not criticize other's cultures, we have in turn made it impossible to criticize our own views

What Aristotle does and does well is that he is able to define and frame ethics in terms of what all human beings have in common
	Features of humanness
		the one thing all humans share
		common set of problems
			the problems and hardships we all experience and can judge morality of how we react to these problem
			grounding experiences
				every human being dies
				every human being gets hungry
				every human being deals with being kind to others

Julia Annas ( 1946 - present )

Habit and Political reason
	Habit is essential for Aristotle
		Need to refer to the things that a person does
		Doing something automatically and doing something because you know its right
		Vice and virtue refers back to the person performing the action
	Affective relation
		enjoying to some degree being virtuous
		no internal conflict
			not being pulled in different directions
		*Constant* Virtue is something we are always striving for
		Don't do the right thing just because it is the right thing because it is right not to impress someone else
	Political Reason
		Can't just fall into doing the right thing
		needs to be a training in practical reasoning
		Education the sense of constant evaluation
			be able to notice when you are doing something wrong and evaluate and correct it
			Detect inconsistency -> coherence
			Always be able to do better than how I am currently doing

Eudaimonia
	moral theory ( right v wrong )
		prescriptive theory
			We should aim for eudaimonia
		"should"
	Flourishing

	Ethical theory ( good v bad )
		strictly descriptive theory
		"do"/"is"
		not arguing that we should live the best life possible, because everyone already is

Virtues themselves ( aspiration / situation )
	virtue is a necessary element
	virtue is no a side interest in human beings, it is a necessary component in everything we do
		if we want to live a good life, we need to do things and do them well
	Virtue is an ideal
		there is a quality within virtue that there is always something better to do
			therefore the pursuit of virtue is constant and to do this we need aspiration
			approaching the limit but never reach it (like a limit in calculus)

Discussion
------------------
- Virtue is something so unattainable, if its so unattainable and is something that doesnt exist why look for it
	- being a good person is something to strive after
	- what is being completely virtuous
	- not thinking about something bad would make you oblivious
	- always doing a good thing and being a good person is virtuous
	- being 100% virtuous is unattainable, no one is truly perfect
		- can do as much as we can to get to virtue
		- there is no truly virtuous person
		- truly virtuous person - someone who embodies virtue
		- one person always does the right thing but doesn't think of the bad
			- self control shows more reasoning similar
	- thinking virtuously makes someone virtuous
	- thinking consciously and being automatically weighed equally

- Are we a better society
	- times change and the societal norms are shifting
	- recent history - the holocaust
	- Western thought - keeping peace and democracy
		- Civil war - killing our own people for the good of amounting to nothing specifically
		- Afghan war - hurting the few but helping the many
	- Authoritarian regimes - are focused on keeping themselves in power rather than society in general
	- The society and culture frames how things are perceived

Ethics west vs middle east
	middle east is through Islam and religion
	changing very rapidly
	being more open
		excited for the future

	The ideals we judge cultures on changes with time

never easy to live a good life
	living for others
	livign for the long game
