NOTES
------------------

Peter Singer ( 1946 - Present )
	Animal Liberation ( 1975 )
		Morality of the treatment of animals from a utilitarian view
	Famine, Affluence, Morality ( 1971 )
		Addressing the Bangladeshi Liberation War

One must morally surrender every bit of money that you have
	It is morally necessary to give all money away to a starving person

Basic premises
	Part 1.) death from suffering from lack of food, shelter, medical attention are bad
	Part 2.) If we can prevent something bad without giving something up of equal bad, we ought to do so, morally speaking
	Part 3.) Suffering and death are happening
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Conclusion.) I ought morally speaking to prevent suffering and death without causing similar suffering and death

Question of scope
	Distance has no effect on the morality of the situation
	If you can ignore something on the other side of the world, can ignore a baby drowning 500 feet away

	Therefore it is not morally acceptable to be partial to those who are close to us

Marginal Utility
	Giving should create more happiness that pain it causes
	Just because many people don't pull their own weight is not a moral excuse to not pull yours

		Moves away of what would we do and asking what *should* we do


DISCUSSION - 5
------------------
Famine relief and character - dosent believe that character comes into play that much
	obligation is important
	not everyone is going to participate and that is influenced by character

Superogatory - good to do and not wrong not to do
	charity - is a good thing but people dont look down on you if you dont donate


Impartiality
	International crises, distance is not a factor
	friends and family should be weighed higher than others
	the trolley problem - only looking at people as units of utility
	hard to live 

Mill's question of scope - how does Singer determine where to send money?
	its objectively better to teach someone skills to make money
	but its better to do broad strokes of good than to nothing
