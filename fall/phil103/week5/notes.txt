Hedonistic Consequentialism = Utilitarianism in short

Consequentialism and Bentham

Aristotle
	Ethics - an account of the good and the bad
		purely descriptive - "is" claims
			something is good / something is bad

Moral Theory - an account of what is right and what is wrong
	more than just what is good and bad, but includes it
	Prescriptive - "ought" and "should" statements
	defining our obligations and duties

Consequentialism - moral theory that holds right and wrong to depend on consequences of an action (outcomes)
	an action is good if it has good outcome, an action is bad if it has bad outcomes

Utilitarianism - a version of consequentialism
	Jeremy Bentham ( 1748 - 1832 ) - founder of utilitarianism
		extremely radically liberal for the time, based on his utilitarian argument
			pushed for abolition of slavery, equal rights for women and homosexuals, etc.

The principles of Morals and Legislation
	Clear statement of what is right and wrong
	apply this principle and make it extendable to all decision making
	morality comes down to adequately applying this principle

The Principle of Utility (PU)
	an action is insofar as it augments happiness and it is wrong insofar as it diminished happiness

What is happiness to Bentham
	happiness = pleasure, benefit, good, advantage, etc
	unhappiness = pain/ absence of pleasure
		Hedonist viewpoint

Utility Calculus
	1.) Intensity
	2.) Duration
	3.) Certainty/ uncertainty
	4.) Propinquity/ remoteness
	^ Me and now
	5.) fecundity - chance of being followed by the same sensations
	6.) purity - not being followed of opposite kinds
	^ future
	7.) extent - the number of persons that it extends to

John Stuart Mill ( 1806-1873 )
------------------
Utilitarianism ( 1863 )
	complete justification of the theory of utilitarianism

Intellectual pleasures
	kept mill alive during deep depression

On Liberty ( 1859 )
	loosely libertarian, argument for freedom of speech
	weird imperialist remarks and justifications using utilitarianism

Subjugation of Women ( 1869 )
	argument for equal female rights

Systematic defense of the theory of utilitarianism

Greatest happiness principle
	utilitarianism - producing the greatest amount of pleasure for the greatest amount of people
	actions can be more or less correct in relation the consequences they produce
	not finding *the* correct decision
	happiness to Bentham and mill = quantifiable pleasures
	unhappiness = pain
	ends and means of activity
		something difficult and painful is good if it brings happiness and pleasure in the long run
		something that is easy and joyful is bad if it brings pain and suffering in the long run

The exclusively quantitative mode of Bentham
	contention between Mills and Bentham
	Bentham = actual units of pleasure called "utils" that can be added, subtracted, multiplied, etc.
	Mill = utils make no damn sense, a pleasure cannot be reduced to another

Quality v Quantity of pleasure
	some pleasures are far more enjoyable than another pleasure
	we cant actually add up units of different activities and compare them
	pleasures are different in kind

Not enough to produce tons of different kinds of pleasure, need to provide the correct pleasures
	not enough to make everyone feel good, must make people actually holistically good

Poll the population what the best pleasure is

Empirical scientific and observation based
	a common sense conclusion
