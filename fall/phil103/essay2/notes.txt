World famine of 828 million people.

How would Kant tackle this problem vs how would O'Neill?
- Kant
	- TODO: add more here
	- Grounding thoughts in the categorical imperative - all things must be universally good
		- "Act only on the maxim whereby thou canst at the same time will that it should become universal law"
			- ^ use this quote lel
		- In this case, positive obligation to help, someone must help one in need
			- Beneficence, universal principle - one must help other people
		- If something is universally or inherently good, it must be applied successfully in all situations
		- Law is an objective principle of the will

- Onora O'Neill
	- The goodness of an action of something is based off of its principles, does it promote more goodness
	- Key is the second categorical imperative - the mere means
		- Must allow for the consent of the other party
			- Cannot coerce, deceive or endanger the other party
			- must maintain the independence of the other party (they need to be autonomous)


Explain the differences between individuals and institutions as each thinker would understand them.
- Kant focuses on the induvidual agents, one must act in accordance with the universal laws at hand, and has a positive obligation to do so
	- In contrast to something like subjective principles and inclinations
	- i will help my mother because it is objectively right to do so, not because i love her

- This Kantian approach is too psychological for institutions, institutions don't have minds
- therefore O'neill shifts to approach this problem with CI-2
	- Make decision that allow for autonomy
	- Treat people with respect and allow them to be their own person
- Governmental bodies don't have minds and moreover the ability to create cognitive thought
- Governments should be looking to establish autonomy
	- cannot get a "matter-of-fact" consent, consent must be clear and willing
	- no profiting off of the misfortune of others



How do the thinkers justify these views?
- CI-1 vs CI-2
- Kant is most concerned with the universal law, one thing must be applied in all situatoins
- O'Neill is most concerned with the mere means and ends in themself


Which figure offers the a more viable option?
- O'Neill offers the far more valuable option in this situation
	-  Issue with Deontology is a lack of ambition - its really hard to get a correct answer
	-  O'Neill introduces the consideration of consequences (only after you haven't used on as a mere means or violated autonomy)
- Biological vs. Biographical life
	- Don't need to fully wipe out the problem however, one could introduce something like sustainable farming
	- proverb of teaching a man to fish vs giving a man a fish
- Welfare at home
	- Cannot overcommit resources that would strain those at home
	- Cannot create dependence through something like welfare
