Virginia Held pt 2

Caring Person
	moral subjectivity - Justice perspective
		in general human life overemphasizes this
	relational subjectivity - Care perspective

Care ethics does not take a single formula that fits everybody

Care is not just feeling (motivation), or actions, or outcomes, but all of them together

Care work
	it is not enough to merely have a good intention
		outcomes matter too
	it is not enough to merely do the right thing
		cannot do something begrudgingly
	care as a practice, in addition to feeling
	developing caring habits
	habit - dispotition towards certain actions

Care indicates a set and dispotitions to actions however, it is not a virtue in of itself
	care ethics is relational, understanding of the good does not refer to dispotitions, actions or outcomes but good relationships
	virtue ethics does not concern itself with the other moral actor
	A1 <---> A2
		A1 and A2 must both care for each other
		in VE, the focus would only be on A1 or A2, not both
		In care ethics, A1 and A2 can both be virtuous, however if there is no relationship, there is no care

No hard set of criteria for evaluating relationships
	however there are loose criteria in the form of understanding a relationship as a whole (motivation (dispotitions), actions, outcomes)

Mutual Autonomy
	Does the realtionship sustain the autonomy of the parties involved
	not as concerned with "Do I make a person feel good", more concerned with "Did I make a person into a caring person?"

Resisting pressures

Mutual engagements
	we can still have justice without solely focussing on justice
	autonomy must be mutual

Situations of oppresion actually exists and caring for people in different ways is allowed
	power dynamics - exchanges between two people
	matter of fact that there are unequal power dynamics, however this is not necessarily bad
		bad when the relationship is uncaring or violates the autonomy
	are you engaging with the lesser power caringly

Discussion - 2
------------------

How can we evaluate the goodness of a person who cannot act?
	Being a person is capable of action
	to what capacity to act
	an old person can still act
	can still create realtionships just such a smaller scale
	cant evaluate kids - there is no past action to draw from
	greatest good is lowered
	not being able to preform the action doesnt mean you cant be a caring person
	what is someone is in a coma
		cant do anything positive or negative
		vegetative
	being a human is being actionable and being able to reason

Are there universal criteria that Held gives to judge behaviors?


Need to care for someone the right way
mutual autonomy - not caring for something the way you want to, caring for someone the way they want

Human dynamics - emotional dynamics can work in strange ways, applying a set of universal principles are rigid and would restrict possibly beneficial relationships

Cutting off ties
	can cut off relationships, previous ties can be stopped according to noddings
	can remove oneself from a relationship, however cannot do so uncaringly

Moral subjectivity is the capacity to act
	in order to be a moral subject, one must be capable of action
	not good or bad
	value that you put on care, it is still good to care for someone who needs help, even if they cannot act

Universal care ethics
	everyone who acts is a person, need to care

Sometimes its ok to lie
	lying to your kid pretending santa claus is real

Care - doing what you are capable of

Held - what it takes to be good
	care, effort, mutual autonomy
	mutually beneficial for both parties
	imbalances of power, can still have good relations

Why are there no universal principles?
	looking at different people, relationships are deeply situational
	difficult to implement universal principles
	lying can be situationally moral, not necessarily bad
		crushing your child's dream with vigorous kantian truths
