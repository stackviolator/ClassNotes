NOTES
------------------

Ethics : good v bad
	Hedonistic good = pleasure

NOTE: Today we are just proving that Pleasure is the only good, even if too much pleasure is bad

There are different types of pleasure
	malicious pleasure is a bad pleasure

Empiricism - an epistemological position
	holds the primary source of knowledge is sensory experience
	science is predicated on the theory of empiricism
	the good must be able to show up on the experience
	pleasure must be derived from experience itself

Reductionism - move things down to observable facts
	how do we know happiness = pleasure
		human beings do in general pursue pleasure
		the sensorial experience of being happy is being full of pleasure
		being happy and being good amount to the same feeling

Ends v means
	ends are desirable
		desire is to find pleasure
	To hold something to and end, means that you find it desirable
		to hold something to be desirable, means that you find it pleasurable

Virtue can be understood as a good in of itself

Need to find happiness not as something abstract but as a concrete whole, a net sum of all pleasure

GHP - Greatest happiness principle, an action is right in it proportion to its tendency to promote happiness

Utlilitarianism != egoism
	impartiality - remove feelings and emotion from decision making in order to be objective with the amount of happiness gained
	the application of the GHP requres the application of objectivity

"problem" of motivation - a person's character and motivations are completetly irrelevant to decision making
	what our obligations are
	can do the right thing for wrong reasons and vice versa
	saving a child
		motivations dont matter
		motivated to save the child for goodness sake vs for the reward of saving the child
	having good intentions does not make an action right
		breaking a promise to care for family - still bad because something went wrong

Scope
	rejecting basic butterfly effect
	public benefits
		if someone holds public office, their actions have a wider effect
	private benefactor
		only take the general people around you when considering moral calculus

	can scale the scope more or less naturally, most people are private benefactors

"problem" of calculation
	have had the entirety of human history to figure things out
	certain actions have certain tendencies
		the tendency of saving a child is clearly positive even if you end of saving baby hitler
	act vs rules utilitarianism
		we need to follow obvious rules
