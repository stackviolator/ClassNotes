NOTES
------------------

Friedrich Nietzsche ( 1844 - 1900 )
	The birth of tragedy ( 1871 )
	Thus Spoke Zarathustra ( 1884 )
	On the Genealogy of Morals ( 1887 )

Life - creative evolution
	most fundamental concept when exploring philosophy
	becoming, process of change
	generating differences
	to live (and therefore to exist) is to become something different constantly
	life is such as to constantly be creating new things

Since life is changing always, universal principles seem to fly in the face of laws of nature

Transvaluation of Values
	what is the point, from the perspective of life, to consider ethics or morals?
	Moral facts as inventions
	 	discovered the categorical imperative in the same sense that we discover the law of gravity
		moral facts are not just given but they are created through reason

What is the value of our values?
	Affirmation of life - embrace the nature or life, in so far as flourishing
	nihilism - life has a negative value
		most of the moral philosophers offer a rejection of the basic principles of life (changes, differences, creativity)
		gives a fundamental hostility to what we are in nature
	life as wrong

Critical method - does an ethical theory criticize or affirm the natural tendencies of life

The Nietzschean "Good"
	all descriptions of good in all ancient languages are describing the traits of a power/ ruling class
	ruling class -> self-description of uniqueness
	pathos of distance (pathos == feeling)
	feeling that i am distinct from someone else
	small subsection in society holds themselves to be special, this differences are what are manifested in their language's interpretation of "Good"


Life affirming or life negating (nihilistic)
	Does creativity/ change have a positive or negative value?

Master/ Noble Morality
	meant to signify a historical instance
	pathos of distance
		every word that is translated to good is pointing to the qualities that make the ruling class distinct
	good vs bad (rare vs common) 		-- 		Ethics
		no negative connotation with being common, only a positive connotation with being rare
		ordinary vs extraordinary
	minoritarian in nature
		yes/ affirmation of life
		action
		"I can"
	self
	descriptive

Slave Morality
	**resentment - ressentiment
		the nature of revolt of the ancient Jews against the Romans
		Jesus of Nazareth flips the notion of morality, emphasis on the masses and lowly
	good vs evil 										-- 		Morality
		it is wrong and wicked to behave immorality
	ancient Jews entirely revolted to the historical view of morality
	Majoritarian
		evolved as Christianity, blessed are the sick, blessed are the weak, blessed are the poor
		no / negation
		reaction
			because someone else is acting towards me, i reject this
			it is wrong to be rich, powerful, etc
			"Thou shalt not" do such and such and such
			rejection of behaviors as fundamentally wrong
		prescriptive
		focused on others
		much more likely to refer to someone else's behavior has wrong than ones own behavior

Master nobility is an examination in what "I" can do and how "I" can be better
	nothing wrong with the way that others behave, only different
Slave morality is an examination in what other people are doing wrong

Human freedom
	it is a person's choice to be immoral
		racist choice to be racist, roman choice to be oppressive
	solution is not to criticize the person for being immoral but to move on
	people can act freely and have choice, however people are generally a sum on their context
	attack on kant -> if a person have free will they are choosing to be evil


Questions
------------------
Social contract - wont harm others so i wont get harmed, therefore, egoist?
