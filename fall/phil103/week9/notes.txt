NOTES
------------------

Things vs Persons
	Things
		Instrumentally good - they are good for a particular purpose
			similar to examples in virtue ethics and utilitarianism
				VE - goodness as a virtue or something
				Util - goodness as a means vs an end
			goodness is conditional/ relative
				goodness is a thing that is predicated on achieving an end
				goodness makes references to human needs/ desires - only care about chalk bc i want to write on a board
				money/ gold has no value except for our propensity to like shiny metals
			objects
				we are the condition for an object to be good
	Persons
		We are mistaken if we ever look at a person as if they were a thing
		a persons value is absolute
			goodness seems to be predicated on the existence of humans
			humans need something and what want/need creates the criteria to judge the goodness of something
			therefore without humans, there would be no goodness
			without human life there would be no goodness, meaning that a person is absolutely good

			Question on absolutism - if each person is equal, how can we justify a death penalty or war?
				Generally is bad

Categorical Imperative II
	Cannot ever treat human beings as if they are things
	must hold them to have an intrinsic value
	Cannot treat someone as a *mere* means
		humans are constantly using each other as means but is moral - we use dr ted as a means to education
		however if there is respect it is not a mere means
		discarding the thing after you are done with using it is a mere means
	lying as a mere means
		if the ends of your actions are obscured it is use as a mere means
	Suicide is a mere means
		tossing my life aside when i no longer want it is treating myself as a mere means
	Beneficence as a means
		if you do not help people out, you deem them to have no value
	self-cultivation
		we hold ourselves to be valuable and have an absolute worth

Autonomy
	cannot force someone to do something moral
		if you exercise force on someone, you are not treating their own morality
	can you force yourself to make a rational decision?

What is Enlightenment - 1784
	How can we have a government that also respects autonomy?

	"Mankind's exit from self-incurred immaturity"
	maturity == autonomy

	Sapre Aude = Latin for "dare to know"
	Don't accept that something is the case because an authority figure said it is so
	an argument that one must think through their world views and thoughts
		this also does not mean to reject all things because they come from an authority figure
		however one must consider and think through them

	How to have a moral society
		all that is required is a degree of freedom
			freedom in this case means to use our public reason

	Public vs Private use of reason
		public use has no restriction, private use may be restricted
		Kant's freedom of speech - Public Use
			someone needs to be "learned" or a scholar to be afforded freedom of speech
			being able to put forward and make arguments while defending the world view while using reason

		Can limit the private use of reason (morally)
			demand the obedience as you are serving under a private function
			may be given an order, as long as the order disrespects me as an autonomous being, one will be bound to follow through with the order

			Ex. Dr Ted and the COVID policy
				Private use - must follow and enforce rules as a private individual representing PSU while in the classroom
				Public use - must be allowed to express opinions to the newspaper

Kingdom of ends
	could this law be self-imposed
	if we were all thinking rationally, could the law be imposed on any one of us? if yes, then a governing body can impose the law
			Categorical imperative 1
		all a government is required to do is to treat everyone was rational and with dignity
			categorical imperative 2

DISCUSSION - 4
------------------
If you have authority over someone, you can have some grounds for control over them
Does the government have the authority over your personal life - within reason
Government needs to keep people in check, needs to restrain people

When does action to be a choice
	forcing ceases to make a choice

Morally justified to vote for a representative

Not affected by bias - opinion based on reason - above reason and more personal

With reason - using rational thought and coming up with an opinion
