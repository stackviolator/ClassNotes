Gilles Deleuze ( 1925 - 1995 )
	Difference and Repition ( 1968 )
	Nietzsche and Philosophy ( 1965 )

Deleuze and Foucault are similar in thought

Is it possible to reverse the slave revolt?
	take a notion of a principle and make it life affirming

Eternal Return Doctrine
	Thought experiment that time is a flat circle, you will live your life over and over infinitely
		"Throw yourself down and gnash your teeth"
		how would one react?
	Cosomological argument - argument from metaphysics - also in terms of Ethics
		Premise 1.) Time is infinite
		Premise 2.) Matter is finite ( cannot be made or destroy )
			With an infinite amount of time and a finite amount of matter, each configuration of matter must happen over and over and over and over again forever
		The circle of life never stops and life is always something that is "becoming"
		conclusion from the two premises, life is circular
		Because time is a circle, there is an idea of fate, therefore there is no real free will, everthing will happen again and again and has already happened
		This is the "Greatest weight"

	How can one be ethical is there is no free will
		once you learn about the eternal return, if your life has not been great, one can change their actions
			practical principle - if you dont like your life so far, chnage the way you live
			"if i had a choice, would i want this to happen or not"
				if you choose that you dont care, this is nihilism
				else, you care about life, you are life-affirming

	Eternal return principle
		"act in such a way as to will the ethernal return of your actions"
		think about your actions as wether or not you want this to happen over and over and over forever
		select the action that is actually worth repeating
		wholly concerned with yourself, life affirming
			only focussed on your own actions, can *I* stomach the fact that *my* action forever

Transvalutation of values
	can still have a principle (Eternal return principle)
		allows us to live a rich, life-affirming life instead of a restrictive kantian principle

Foucault - what does it concretely mean to live a life-affirming life

Michel Foucault ( 1926 - 1984 )
	used Nietzschean philosophy as a methodology
	Madness and Civilization ( 1961 )
	Disciple and Punish ( 1975 )
	The History of Sexuality ( 1976 )

	The Genealogy of Ethics ( 1984 )
		Sets out to revise the notion of the geneology

Exploring the hisotry of ethical concepts to understand a holistic view

Transvaluation of values - looking at values in different culture, times, etc. and seeing how they stack up, do they persist?

If you examine the sources, there are prescriptions, when to do things and when to not do things

There is something like master morality framework, a system where a small subsection of people are not concerned with what one group does, but the shoulds and shouldn't do seem to be there

Aesthetic basis for ethics
	presecriptions ( morality )
	you should do or you should not do beautifys ones existence
	doing something so you can form a beautiful memory
	there is a transvaluation of some values, do not have excessive sex, only have sex with your married partner
		thou shalt not commit adultery, etc. in slave morality
		however these persist in master morality, it is beautiful to love and beautiful to be loyal
	concerns for morality in the modern world

Can morality be life affirming?
	looking at old frameworks of morality and ethics
	analysis of prescriptions

Giving style to ones character
	what seemed to be going on in the ancient context
	i do something so i become the person i want to be, someone admirable
	creatively shaping who i am
	creating habits and

Satisfying to behold = someone beautiful
	fun wordplay by Nietzsche

Aesthetics of existence
	life as a work of art
	art has rules
		music - a structure that must be upheld
		painting - certain brush strokes
		no hard and fast set of rules
			can be a cubist or an impressionist -> a certain style to your character
			IN TERMS OF ETHICS -> can be a utilitarian or Deontologist, etc -> style to your character

Foucault wants to argue that our lives can be art
	they can be good or beautiful or bad or ugly
	prescriptions as techniques to make you a certain style
	there is good and bad art -> people who have no technique

Care of the self
	to take concern in the acutal life that we are living
	empimeleia heatou - "working on" or "being concerned with something" taking care of one's self however not being self-centered
	employ the morality of a specific school of thought however do not get mad at others if they do not comply

Questions
-------------
Why specifically is aesthetics a good basis for ethics? What justification does Foucault offer?
