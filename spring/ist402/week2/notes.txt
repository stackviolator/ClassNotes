Rob Nixon's "Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor"
  - Slow Violence
  	- Most of the environmental problems we face are not sudden, but rather are characterized by a slow motion urgency
  	- eg. deforestation, happens over the course of a long period of time
  	- occurs gradually and out of sight
  	- Attrition = the process of wearing down by degrees, long and over time
  	- How do you account for slow violence
  	  - notice structural violence
  	    - vast structures that give rise to violence ex. World Bank and IMF's structural adjustment programs
      - Anthropocene - impact of human species, since the industrial era onward
      - Age of degraded attention -> Tik Tok economy

  - The Environmentalism of the Poor
    - official landscapes
      - governments, NGOs, corporations, etc.
    - Vernacular landscapes
      - people who live in the landscape
    - clash of temporal perspectives between the shorttermers who arrive and the longtermers who live there
