NOTES
------------------

Techniques
	- AV scanning ex. VirusTotal
	- Hashes
	- A file's strings, functions, and headers

	Number systems
		- humans count in base 1o
		- computers count in base 2
		- computers also use base 16 (hexadecimal)

	Packing/ obfuscation
		- Code compression (e.g. UPX, zip files)
		- makes the strings and instructions harder to read
		- only see the wrapper code
			- wrapper code is small cod ethat unpacks the file when it is ran

	FLOSS
		- Strings on steroids for FLARE VM
		- pulls out static, stack, tight, and decoded strings

	PE File Format
		- Portable Executable
		- Windows file format
		  - Used by files, object code and DLLs
		- Data structure that contains the info necessary for windows to execute a file
		- Almost every file executed on windows is a PE file
		- PE files are divided into sections
		  - Sections include:
				- DOS MZ Header
				- DOS Stub
				- PE File Header
					- PE Signature
					- Information where the executbale needs to be loaded into memory
					- Space requirements
					- Library dependencies (DLLs)
					- Information where the executable begins
				- Image optional header
				- Section Table
				- Sections
					- .idata
						- Import Address Table
					- .rsrc
						- Resource Directory
						- strings, icons, images, menus, dialogs, etc.
					- .rdata
						- import and exports
					- .data
						- Initialized Data (global data)
					- .text
						- text section contains the actual code
						- binary data that the CPU executes
					- .src
						- Source code (if it exists) (source C?)

	Time Date Stamp
		- Time and date when the file was created
		- Can be used to determine if a file has been modified
		- Date can be faked

	IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER
		- Virtual Size - RAM
		- Size of raw data - size of the section on disk
		- For .text section, normally equal, or nearly equal
		- Packed exes show Virtual Size much larger than the size of raw data for .text section

Imports
	functions used by a program that are stored in a different program, such as a library
	connectec through linking
	three types of linking
		static
		  rare in windows
		run time
			unpopular in friendly programs
			common in malware
			connect to libraries only when needed, not when the program starts
			funcs used: LoadLibrary, GetProcAddress
		dynamic
			most common method
			hsot os searched for libraries when the program is loaded/ starts

Clues in libraries
	the PE header lists every library and function that will be loaded
	their names can reveal what the program does
	URLDownloadToFile - the program is going to download a file

Dynamically Linked Functions
	normal programs have a lot of DLLs
	malware often has very few

Exports
	DLs export functions
	EXEs import functions but not absolute
	both exports and imports are listed in the PE header

Example keylogger
	imoprts User32.dll and uses the function SetWindowsHookEx which is a popular way keyloggers recv keyboard inputs
	exports LowLevelKeyboardProc and LowLevelMouseProc to send the data elsewhere
	uses RegisterHotKey to define a special keystroke like Ctrl+Shift+P to harvest the collected data

Packed program
	very few functions
	all you see is the unpacker

Strings info
	Host info - info relavent to the particular system/ machine
	network info - how the malware is going to make network connections and what it will do with them
