NOTES
------------------

Techniques
	- AV scanning ex. VirusTotal
	- Hashes
	- A file's strings, functions, and headers

	Number systems
		- humans count in base 1o
		- computers count in base 2
		- computers also use base 16 (hexadecimal)

	Packing/ obfuscation
		- Code compression (e.g. UPX, zip files)
		- makes the strings and instructions harder to read
		- only see the wrapper code
			- wrapper code is small cod ethat unpacks the file when it is ran

	FLOSS
		- Strings on steroids for FLARE VM
		- pulls out static, stack, tight, and decoded strings

	PE File Format
		- Portable Executable
		- Windows file format
		  - Used by files, object code and DLLs
		- Data structure that contains the info necessary for windows to execute a file
		- Almost every file executed on windows is a PE file
		- PE files are divided into sections
		  - Sections include:
				- DOS MZ Header
				- DOS Stub
				- PE File Header
					- PE Signature
					- Information where the executbale needs to be loaded into memory
					- Space requirements
					- Library dependencies (DLLs)
					- Information where the executable begins
				- Image optional header
				- Section Table
				- Sections
					- .idata
						- Import Address Table
					- .rsrc
						- Resource Directory
						- strings, icons, images, menus, dialogs, etc.
					- .rdata
						- import and exports
					- .data
						- Initialized Data (global data)
					- .text
						- text section contains the actual code
						- binary data that the CPU executes
					- .src
						- Source code (if it exists) (source C?)

	Time Date Stamp
		- Time and date when the file was created
		- Can be used to determine if a file has been modified
		- Date can be faked

	IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER
		- Virtual Size - RAM
		- Size of raw data - size of the section on disk
		- For .text section, normally equal, or nearly equal
		- Packed exes show Virtual Size much larger than the size of raw data for .text section
