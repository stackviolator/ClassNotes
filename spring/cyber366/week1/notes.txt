NOTES
------------------

After an incident happens
	- did the attacker implement persistence
	- is the attacker really gone
	- did the attacker steal or add anything
	- what was the root cause of the attack

Malware analysis goals
	- how the malware works
	- how to identify it (IOCs)
	- how to defeat or eliminate it

Malware types
	- Rootkit
		- designed to enable unauthorized access or control of a system
		- masks existence with other code
		- usually paired with a backdoor
	- Backdoor
		- allows attackers to bypass auth
		- symptoms: connections opened, inconsistent privs, unexplained running processes
	- Botnet
	- Scareware
		- Frightens the user into doing somethin
- etc.

Static vs. Dynamic Analysis
	- Static
		- Examines malware without running it
		- Debuggers, disassemblers
	- Dynamic
		- run the malware and monitor its affects
		- use a VM in a sandbox and take snapshots
		- Tools: RegShot, ProcMon, Process Hacker, CaptureBAT
		- Ram Analysis: Mandiant Redline and Volatility

Basic Static Analysis
	- View malware without looking at the instructions
	- Tools: VirusTotal and strings
	- Quick and easy but fails for advacned malware and can miss important behavior

Basic Dynamic Analysis
	- Easy but requires a safe test env
	- Not effective on all malware
		- Sandbox detection malware evades this form of dynamic analysis

Advanced static analysis
	- Reverse engineering with a disassembler
	- complex and need to understand asm

Advanced dynamic analysis
	- Run code in a debugger and monitor its behavior
	- examine the internal state of a running executable

General Rules for Malware Analysis
	- Not every piece of malware fits a category
	- Don't get caught in the details
		- you don't need to understand 100% of the code
			- is it opening a port and waiting for incoming connections? its a backdoor
			- dont need to understand each asm instruction of opening the socket and sending and recv bytes
		- focus on key features
	- Try multiple tools
	- Document everything
	- Malware authors are constant getting more complex
