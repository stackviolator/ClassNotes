Malware analysis in virtual machines

Sandboxes
	- all in one sofrare for basic dynaic analysis
	- virtualized and sumulates network services
	- GFI, cuckoo, joesandbox, etc.
	- often prodice summarized reports
	- Limitations
		- not all malware is detected
		- not all malware is analyzed
		- the environment may not be correct for the malware to rub
		- malware may detect the sandbox and not run
		- only report basic functionality of the sandbox

Launching DLLs
	- exes can be ran by themself, DLLs cannot
	- use rundll32.exe to launch DLLs
	- rundll32.exe <dllname>,<function>
	- ex: rundll32.exe C:\malware.dll,main
	- ex: rundll32.exe xyzzy.dll, #5
		- uses an ordinal value to call a function
	- ex: rundll32.exe C:\malware.dll,main "C:\Users\Public\Documents\malware.txt"
	- The exported arguments value is one of the exported functions you found in PEview, PEstudio, or other PE file analysis tool

Process Monitor (procmon)
	- monitors file system, registry, process activity, thread activity, and network activity
	- all recorded evetns are kept but you can filter the display to make it easier to find items of interest
	- dont run it too long or it will fill up all the RAM

Process Explorer (procexp)
	- Coloring
		- Services are pink
		- processes are blue
		- new processes are green (briefly)
		- terminated processes are red

Properties
	- verify button checks the disk file's signature
	- particularly useful to verify whether windows files on disk has been corrupted
	- verifies the disk image, not the RAM image (wont detect process replacement)
	- also has strings built in

Windows Registry
	- database that stores low-level settings, config, other values for Windows and applications
	- Malware often modifies the registry to make sure it is launched after reboot, hide itself, or to integreate with an existing application
	- Inspect with regshot
