- Performance of a Contract
	- Usually there are benchmarks and people are happy and satisfied
		- Measuring that performance is on track
	- Material obligations that are not met, one party can be in breach of contract
		- Things that are important enough to sway the decision of entering the contract
		- It is possible to excuse performance under certain circumstances
	- Need to be able to prove that the other party was in breach of contract -> the whole point of having a contract

- Breach of Contract
	- Breach occurs where there is a material failure to act or perform obligations as outlined by the contract
	- The breaching party is then subject to the remedies provisions of the contract
	- Such remedies may include:
		* Direct damages: difference between performance received and performance promised
		* Consequential damages: things that follow from the breach, beyond just direct damages themselves
		   ** Fedex doesnt deliver the package, you lose business because of late delivery
