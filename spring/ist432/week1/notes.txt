The Legal Process
------------------
Law - a set of rules set forth by and for society and government that guides our actions
	not all rules and customs are law but all laws are binding rules
	law is dynamic and changes with society and technology
	there are many different types of law
		- Substantive law
			- What it is that you're allowed to do
			- creates, defines and regulates the legal rights and obligations of the parites
			- Common law vs. statutory or civil law (legal code)
			- Well defined and know exactly what the law is
				- ex. Speed limit of 35 is clear and defined

		- Common law
			- Based on judicial precedent; interpreation of prior case law by judges
			- based on unwritten laws of England; focus on broas principles rather than rules
			- Unwritten notion of "lets protect the environment" without an explicit law
			- Flexible - since it is based on the previous rulings of judges, it can be re-interpreted in the future

		- criminal law
			- prosecution and imposition of penalties by the government of a person for an act that has been classified as a crime
			- dispute between private parties and society
			- needs to be very clearly defined and written
			- typically the court system errs on the side of the person who is charged

		- civil law (non-criminal law)
			- legal rules and priinciples applied in non-criminal matters

		- constitutional law
			- interprets and implements the US consititution with respect to intergovernmental and government/ induvidual relationships; focus on supreme court rulings
			-

		- Procedural law
			- prescribes the rules, practices and procedures that are used to enforce Substantive law
			- lots of ways to get cases to get dismissed or do some voodoo lawyer magic
			- laws that layout the way on how to do things
				- ex. Laws defining how the police can pull you over and give you a speeding ticket

		- civil law (statutory law)
			- based on the legal codes and statues enacted by legislature
			- predictable, provides greater clarity

		- administrative law
			- laws and legal principles made by administrative agencies (Fed and state) that govern their administration and relugation

		- international law
			- rules and principles that govern the relations of nations with each other

		- etc.
	we are bound by all criminal laws however with differnet types of laws bind different types of entities
		IP laws, business regulations, etc. bind corporations

    Common laws that are passed on a daily basis are precedent
