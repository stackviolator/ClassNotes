The Legal Process
------------------
Law - a set of rules set forth by and for society and government that guides our actions
	not all rules and customs are law but all laws are binding rules
	law is dynamic and changes with society and technology
	there are many different types of law
		- Substantive law
			- What it is that you're allowed to do
			- creates, defines and regulates the legal rights and obligations of the parites
			- Common law vs. statutory or civil law (legal code)
			- Well defined and know exactly what the law is
				- ex. Speed limit of 35 is clear and defined

		- Common law
			- Based on judicial precedent; interpreation of prior case law by judges
			- based on unwritten laws of England; focus on broas principles rather than rules
			- Unwritten notion of "lets protect the environment" without an explicit law
			- Flexible - since it is based on the previous rulings of judges, it can be re-interpreted in the future

		- criminal law
			- prosecution and imposition of penalties by the government of a person for an act that has been classified as a crime
			- dispute between private parties and society
			- needs to be very clearly defined and written
			- typically the court system errs on the side of the person who is charged

		- civil law (non-criminal law)
			- legal rules and priinciples applied in non-criminal matters

		- constitutional law
			- interprets and implements the US consititution with respect to intergovernmental and government/ induvidual relationships; focus on supreme court rulings
			-

		- Procedural law
			- prescribes the rules, practices and procedures that are used to enforce Substantive law
			- lots of ways to get cases to get dismissed or do some voodoo lawyer magic
			- laws that layout the way on how to do things
				- ex. Laws defining how the police can pull you over and give you a speeding ticket

		- civil law (statutory law)
			- based on the legal codes and statues enacted by legislature
			- predictable, provides greater clarity

		- administrative law
			- laws and legal principles made by administrative agencies (Fed and state) that govern their administration and relugation

		- international law
			- rules and principles that govern the relations of nations with each other

		- etc.
	we are bound by all criminal laws however with differnet types of laws bind different types of entities
		IP laws, business regulations, etc. bind corporations

    Common laws that are passed on a daily basis are precedent

		Right to Repair - companies who do business in NY need to abide by certain guidelines such as publishing schmeatics and not voiding warranties if a person repairs their device

Categories of Substantive Law
	Contract Law
		Regulates all apsects of agreements between parties
		includes sales and service contracts, employment contracts, etc.
	Tort Law
		a tort is a civil wrong that gives rise to a cause of action or compensation
		toers may be intentional or negligent
		includes negligence, defamation, invasion of privacy, etc.
		slip and fall, no cleared spill in the supermarket, etc.
		  Things lawyers advertise for on TV
		intentional torts - battery, assault, false imprisonment, etc.
	Cyberspace implications for both categories


The US Legal System
	law is made and interpreted in the US through a combination of court cases, statutes adn admin regulations
		all three are interrelated and interdependent
	courts interpret statutory law and apply common law principles
	Supreme Court often interprets the US consititution "the supreme law of the land"

	Statuory Law
		role of statutory law growing in the US, esp on issues relating to emerging technologies and info science
		statues are passed by congress and state legislatures and seek to regulate conduct with higher degree of precision
		statues dealing with arious aspects of info tech and in particular privary and info sec
			began to proliferate in the 1970s
	Regulatory Law
		us fed govt has empowered many agencies to promulgate regulations that implement and enforce statutes
		especially applicable to regulation of issues of financial privacy
		regulatory investigations can lead to civil or criminal penalties
		FTC = defacto privacy regulator (cool!)
		  Ex. Microsoft/ Blizzard merger
				Microsoft wants to acquire Blizzard, Blizzard wants to be acquired
				Companies need a merger approval from the govt, the FTC does not want to approve the merger
	Case Precedents
		under "Stare Decisis" courts are bound by prior decisions
		binding precedings - generally a lower court must respect the rulings of higher courts within the legal "chain of command"
		persuasive precedents - courts are not bound by the rulings of lower (or peer) courts but are encouraged to follow them
