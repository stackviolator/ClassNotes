2.1.1 - Technology Policy Environment

Public Policy
course of action by the government to address public issues and promote the “common good” by developing laws, regulations, decisions, and actions

Public policy goals:
Making many commercial and other promises binding and legally enforceable (contract law)
Rationale: enforcing mutual promises between parties who intended to be legally bound is fair

Tort law establishes conditions under which victims of injuries caused by others can shift costs they incur
Rationale: those responsible for causing injury intentionally or negligently should, in certain instances, be held liable for damages

Legal protection of property, including intellectual
Rationale: protect rights of inventor, author or creator
Provide incentives to conceptualize and publicly introduce new ideas

Individuals right to privacy must be balanced by the gov’s legitimate need to collect and use data to promote security
Rationale: balance between individuals right to privacy and society’s legitimate needs for info
First Amendment, Democracy, Law Enforcement/Counter-terrorism, freemarkets

Policy formation in the US involve a number of overlapping domains (checks and balances)
Federal vs state laws
Congress v Courts
Congress v Executive

Note: policies made in states are analogous to the Federal process


2.1.2

Article 1, Section 8 of the US Constitution sets forth the explicit powers of the federal government
10th amendment: all powers not enumerated in Constitution are reserved for the states

“Commerce Clause”- source of much disagreement between federal power and states rights

“Supremacy Clause” - in cases where federal authority is exclusive, policymaking is clear
More difficult when federal law does not explicitly preempt state action
In case of conflict: federal laws win

First Amendment Issues
Internet has expanded possibilities for dissemination of “speech”

Much of the Congressional policymaking in the field of info science has focused on strengthening intellectual property protection in response to advances in technology




2.2.1 - Regulation of Cyberspace

Who regulates Cyberspace?
Lack of formal framework; nobody’s domain
but doesn’t mean it's NOT regulated: content is regulated

Public vs “Private” Regulation
Very little of cyberspace is under public control
Problems of geography and sovereignty in cyberspace

Private Regulatory Entities
ICANN (Internet corporation for assigned names and numbers)
Administers domain-name system
HOWEVER, lack of accountability and gets too involved in policy making

Net Neutrality
A principle that all movement and content on the Internet should receive equal treatment
2015: established that required Internet providers to treat all websites equally
2017: FCC eliminated rules established in 2015

Law and Technology – Fundamental Premises:
Technological advances often necessitate changes in law
Technological measures can be used to replace or supplant the balances struck by formal legal regulation
Legal rules can affect the technological options that may be made available

Fourth Amendment Elements
Ensures independent judicial oversight
General requires a search warrant supported by “probable cause”
Requires reasonable expectation of privacy
Only constrains government law enforcement

Fourth Amendment Exceptions
Consent
Exigent circumstances
Plain view
Special needs


2.2.2 - Regulation of Cyberspace

Olmstead v. US (1928)
Prohibition-era physical wiretaps on Seattle bootleggers phones from “in the street”
Physical trespass violation required

Katz v. US (1967)
FBI attached microphone to glass public telephone booth
Used to convict Katz for transmitting wagering information
Appeals Court rejected Katz’s Fourth Amendment argument



Katz Holding
If person can justifiably expect that a conversation was private, it is protected from”unreasonable search and seizure” by the Fourth Amendment
Fourth Amendment protects people, not places

Harlan’s Concurrence in Katz
Justice HArlan’s concurrence created teh “reasonable expectation of privacy test”

Kyllo v US (2001)
Suspicious: Interior Department agent suspected Kyllo growing marijuana in home
Warrantless thermal imaging supported contention that Kyllo was using high intensity lamps
Corroborated by tips and utility bills: basis for search warrant
Supreme Court ruled that thermal imaging constituted a “search”
Gov cannot conduct unreasonable searches, even with technology that does not enter the home
Dissent: use of thermal imaging not a “search” since people can detect heat emissions

Riley v California (2014)
US Supreme Court determined that a warrant is required to search digital information on a cell phone seized pursuant to a person’s arrest
Some warrantless searches of cellphones may be permitted in emergencies
Exception exists to protect officer safety and preserving evidence


Technological Protection Measures
Programs that limit distribution and use of digital content
TPMs seek to accomplish through technology that was previously accomplished by contract

Unlawful behavior that is connected with a given technology can be addressed in two major ways:
Regulate the actual behavior
Regulate the technology that enables people to engage in the unlawful behavior

Sony Corp of America v. Universal City Studios
Court held VCR manufacturer not liable for creating technology that some customers may use for copyright infringing purposes, so long as the technology is capable of non infringing uses

MGM Studios Inc v Grokster (2005)
MGM and others sued the maker of the Morpheus, Grokster, etc aiming to set a precedent to use against other technology companies (P2P and other)
SCOTUS reversed Sony ruling, crafting new doctrine of copyright infringement liability called “inducement”



2.3.1 - The First Amendment and Content Regulation

Internet has expanded all types of “speech” and expanded access to info considered by many to be undesirable/harmful
Porn, hate speech, radical speech

First Amendment - “freedom of speech”
Courts analyzing type of speech and type of regulation
Restrictions on Free Speech
Types of speech
Commercial speech less protected
Speech that has less constitutional value
Speech related to fundamental rights and liberties usually gets most protection

Content Based Restrictions
Regulate speech based on its subject matter or viewpoint

Restrictions on Free Speech
Intermediate scrutiny generally applied to “non-content based” restrictions

Non-Content Based Restrictions - regulate speech without regard to its subject matter or the viewpoint conveyed

First Amendment Analysis:
Does the law regulate speech?
How much protection does the kind of speech get?
Is the law aimed at the speech or at the effects of the speech?

Challenges to Restrictions on Free Speech
Applied challenge: assets that the speech in question is protected by the First Amendment with respect to a certain individual
Facial challenge: asserts that the law under which the speech is being punished reaches too much speech that clearly is protected

The Supreme Court has developed the doctrines of substantial overbreadth and vagueness:
Overbreadth Doctrine: a statute that affects first amendment rights is unconstitutional if it prohibits more protected speech or activity than is necessary to achieve a compelling gov interest
Vagueness Doctrine: a law is facially invalid if persons of “common intelligence must necessarily guess as at its meaning and differ as to its application”


2.3.2- The First Amendment and Content Regulation

Communications Decency Act
initial attempt by Congress to regulate obscene, indecent or otherwise sexually explicit material on the Internet

Legal challenges to “indecent” and “patently offensive”:
Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union

Child Online Protection Act
Enacted in an effort to shield children from internet pornography

Commercial speech: speech that proposes a commercial transaction or an depression related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience

Central Hudson Test: analyzes the constitutionality of restrictions on commercial speech with elements:
Is expression protected by First Amendment?
Is the asserted government interest substantial?
Does regulation directly advance government interest?
Is regulation more extensive than necessary?

Rowan v US Post Office Department (1970)
Statute allowed individuals to request removal from mass mailing lists
Spam mailers challenged on first amendment grounds
Holding: commercial entities do not have right to “force” information on unwilling recipients

Mainstream Marketing Services, Inc v FTC (2004)
Telemarketers challenged the national do not call list
Holding: do not call registry valid commercial speech regulation, meets criteria of central hudson

US West Inc v FCC
Telecoms changed FCC regulations prohibiting use of CPNI to market services without obtaining affirmative consent
Holding: applies CHT and concludes the regulations infringed upon commercial speech

Trans Union Corp v FTC
FTC ordered Trans Union to cease selling targeted marketing lists
Holding: “speech” in question was for a business audience, not a matter of public concern (no strict scrutiny)

Sorrell v IMS Health
Vermont law restricted the sale. Disclosure and use of pharmacy records that reveal the prescribing practices of individual doctors
Holding: vermont did not show that its law had a “neutral justification”
