6.2 Domain Names
- Domain Names
	- similar to domain Names
	- use famous or distinctive trademarks or brand names
	- Domain name vs trademarks
		- Domain names are unique, more than on company can have the same brand but there is only one "company.com"
	- Domains may be generic - generally trademark law will nto give protectoin to generic words "computer" "software" etc
	- trademarks protect a limited set of good or services, domain name are exclusive, anything associated with the owner's website
	- Registering regulated by ICANN (private entity)
	- Domain names are served on a first come first serve basis, no real checking
- Cybersquatting
	- Registering a domain name like google.com and keeping it for yourself so the company is forced to by it to you
	- Registrars must follow the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP) - FROM ICANN
		- most trademark based domains must be resolved by agreement, arbitration, court action, etc. before a registrar can transfer the domain
		- disputes alleged to arise from abusive registrations of domain names may be addressed by expedited admin proceeding
			- things like cybersquatting can be expedited
	- anti Cybersquatting consumer protection act - from US GOVT (ACPA)
		- liability for bad faith intent to profit from the mark
		- is identical or confusingly similar to distinctive or famous registered mark
		- or dilutive of a famous mark
		- injunction against using domain name or statutory damages up to $100k for using the domain
		- Shields v. Zuccarini
			- Zuccarini registered thousnads of domains and many misspellings earning up to a mil a year
			- argued that the ACPA only applied to those trying to squat a domain and then sell it back to the owner
			- intentional misspelling are confusingly similar and therefore zuccarini had to pay 100k * 5 domain names
- Anit-Dilution Protection
	- tranishing
		- association of the mark with inferiour or unsavory products
	- blurring
		- the distinctiveness of the mnark is "whittled away" even if there is no tarnishing
	- First amendment issues
		- Gripe sites, nikesucks.com something like that are fine
	- Bally Fitness vs Faber
		- faber was unhappy and make a stinky website about bally, court allowed faber to keep their site up
			- No confusion, no monetary motivation
	- Federal trademark dilution act of 1996
		- If one use of something puts the other in bad light there does not need to be evidence of confusion or competition
